    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>

      hearty texture, perfect for serving alongside soups and stews.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 and 3/4 cups buttermilk</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). Lightly grease a baking sheet or
        line it with parchment paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking
        soda, and salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour in the
        buttermilk.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a wooden spoon or your hands, mix the buttermilk into the dry
        ingredients until you have a soft dough.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it briefly,
        just until it comes together.
      </li>
      <li>
        Shape the dough into a round loaf and place it on the prepared baking
        sheet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use a sharp knife to score a deep cross into the top of the loaf, then
        bake in the preheated oven for 30-40 minutes, or until the bread is
        golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer the bread to a wire rack to cool completely before slicing and
        serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
